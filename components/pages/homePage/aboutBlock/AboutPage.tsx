                        Hello, I&apos;m a lifelong learner with a passion for programming and mathematics.
                        I started coding in college after pivoting away from medicine, and I&apos;ve been enjoying my journey as a software engineer ever since.
                        I hope to learn from others and continuously grow as an engineer.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        I completed my B.S in Computer Science from UT Dallas, and am currently doing an M.S in Computer Science at UT Austin ðŸ¤˜. I am interested in machine learning and software development.
                        I have worked at Spacee(startup), Robert Half, and currently Geico Tech.
                        Outside of work, my hobbies include fitness, movies, and League of Legends. I enjoy watching LoL esports, tennis, and more recently college football.
